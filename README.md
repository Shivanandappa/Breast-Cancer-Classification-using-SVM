# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-SVM

**Business challenge**:Breast cancer the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases and affected 2.1 million people in 2015 early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.

The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning techniques that can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis. 

Research indicated that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.

In this case study our task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features of pain from several cell images.

**CASE STUDY:**
Data set features are like Radius, Texture, Perimeter,area,smoothness

Dataset
Number of instances:57
Class Distribution : 212 Malignant, 357 Benign. 


**CONCLUSION:**
Machine learning techniques (SVM) was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Benign with 97% accuracy.
